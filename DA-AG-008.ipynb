    "## Question 1: What is Simple Linear Regression (SLR)? Explain its purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** Simple Linear Regression (SLR) models the linear relationship between a single independent variable (X) and a dependent variable (Y). Its purpose is to estimate how changes in X predict changes in Y (prediction) and to quantify the strength and direction of that linear relationship (inference).\n",

    "- **Independence:** Observations (and their errors) are independent.\n",
    "- **Homoscedasticity:** The residuals have constant variance across X.\n",
    "- **Normality of errors:** Residuals are approximately normally distributed (important for inference).\n",
    "- **No perfect measurement error / No extreme outliers:** Predictors and outcomes are measured reasonably and no undue influential points.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Answer:** Logistic Regression is a classification model used when the dependent variable is categorical (commonly binary). It models the log-odds (logit) of the probability of class 1 as a linear function of predictors and uses the logistic (sigmoid) function\n",
